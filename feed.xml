        <title>Welcome to the Singularity Hub Archive</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the Singularity Hub Archive! I (&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/vsoch&quot;&gt;@vsoch&lt;/a&gt;) was recently wanted to search the current archive
for a container, and I realized it was not possible. While I could navigate through collection names, the true content I needed to search
was the Singularity recipe files, and I couldn‚Äôt do that. To support better search of this content, we‚Äôve created
this small site that exposes it (and will reference the correct &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;shub://&lt;/code&gt; URI to pull, along with showing you the full,
original recipe for the container. Yes, it‚Äôs been over 5 years since Singularity Hub went online (and months since it went offline)
but I am still thinking about my promise of reproducibility for these containers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And now that we‚Äôre here, Happy Halloween! üëªÔ∏è&lt;/p&gt;
