Welcome to the Singularity Hub Archive! I ([@vsoch](https://github.com/vsoch)) was recently wanted to search the current archive
for a container, and I realized it was not possible. While I could navigate through collection names, the true content I needed to search
was the Singularity recipe files, and I couldn't do that. To support better search of this content, we've created
this small site that exposes it (and will reference the correct `shub://` URI to pull, along with showing you the full,
original recipe for the container. Yes, it's been over 5 years since Singularity Hub went online (and months since it went offline)
but I am still thinking about my promise of reproducibility for these containers.

And now that we're here, Happy Halloween! üëªÔ∏è
